Mealprepper
By Keaton McGuirk

This is a Rails app that allows users to create and save recipes, as well as 'preps'. Preps are lists of recipes that detail what meals will be prepared in a given time period. They can be used to organize meal plans, and compile ingredients into one easy-to-use shopping list.

To get started, create an account by visiting '/users/sign_in' or by clicking the sign in link at the top of the page. Now you are able to create and save any recipes and preps that appeal to you.


Creating Recipes:
    To create a new recipe, make sure you are logged in and navigate to '/recipes/new' by clicking on the new recipe button at the bottom of the 'my recipes' section.
    Enter the name of the recipe and the steps needed to execute it and click create.
    Next, click on the edit recipe button and add an ingredient that you need to make the recipe, then click update recipe.
    Repeat adding ingredient process until all the ingredients are added.
    If you would like this recipe to be discoverable by others, check the box to make the recipe public in this edit screen.
    Congratulations, You have created a recipe!

Saving Recipes from others
    Mealprepper is full of recipes from other skilled cooks using this site, and using others recipes is easier that creating your own, so how does this work?
    Public recipes are visible at '/discover', which can be located via the 'Discover New Recipes' link at the bottom of the 'My Recipes' Page.
    Click on any recipe that catches your fancy and you can see the recipe itself as well as the author. If you like the recipe, click on the 'save recipe' button at the top of the screen.
    Now this recipe is available to add to any of your preps.

Creating Preps:
    Preps are an easy and efficient way to plan meals for the week and have a one stop shopping list for all the meals.
    Create a new prep by navigating to '/preps/new', which can be found by the 'Create New Prep' Link in the 'My Preps' section. Choose a name for your prep and click create and you got a prep started.
    Add a recipe to the prep by selecting it from the dropdown menu and clicking save. The ingredients list automatically updates for you. Only recipes that you have created or saved are available for your preps, so if you want to use a recipe, be sure to save it.
    Make preps public or private using the 'Make Public' or 'Make Private' Button at the top of the page, and remove recipes with the 'remove this recipe button'.
    Now you can get started creating your very own preps.

Saving Preps from Others:
    This is just like saving recipes, but for preps.
    Navigate to '/discover_preps' from the 'Discover New Preps' link at the bottom of the 'My Preps' page. Pick whichever prep catches your eye, and click on the 'save prep' button at the top. Now, you can find and keep track of this prep more easily.
